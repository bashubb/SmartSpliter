# Smart Spliter

## Overview:

Smart Spliter's main function is to facilitate the splitting of bills among users in a convenient and efficient manner. This feature allows users to divide the bill for purchases, meals, or other expenses within a group, so that each participant can pay a proportional amount. In the app, users can add expenses, specify who participated in each expense, and determine how the bill should be split (e.g., evenly, proportionally to each person's expenses). The bill splitting feature in Smart Spliter aims to simplify financial management in groups, eliminating the need for separate tracking of each expense and manual calculation of each person's share. This allows users to focus on shared activities, knowing that financial settlements are handled smoothly and fairly.
